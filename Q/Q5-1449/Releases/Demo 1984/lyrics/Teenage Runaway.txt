	( F. Rose / J. K. ) 

Some of you may have high hopes 
You fill your heads with dreams, it ain't no joke 
You're waiting for that time you're on your own 
You think that it's a crime that you're unknown 

Someday you may be a teenage runaway 
Someday you may be a teenage runaway 

You can't wait to start on your own 
You're not scared of being alone 
You want to be a star, hear the people scream your name 
And you can't bear the thought of never having fame 

Someday you may be a teenage runaway 
Someday you may be a teenage runaway 

In your dreams you've got it made 
All you worked for finally paid 
But wait a minute, you're not dreaming 
Ten thousand people as one screaming 
Every day you bought those magazines 
That told you all about the Rock' n' Roll scene 
You had to imagine your face on every page 
You can't help thinking about all the times you've paid 

Someday you may be a teenage runaway 
Someday you may be a teenage runaway

	( F. Rose / J. K. ) 

I got a hunger, a feeling that can't be fed 
For the good looks and the charms of a woman 
A woman dressed in red 
My body hurts, my heart it aches 
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake 
If she's feeling nasty I've got good news 
She's not alone just stand in my shoes 

Nothing ventured - nothing gained 
Nothing ventured - nothing gained 

When I needed money, they told me go find a job 
So I gave it a try, worked all day like a dog 
My body hurts, my heart it aches 
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake 
When I walk out, I never go back 
If that makes you sorry, just stop in your tracks 

Nothing ventured - nothing gained 
Nothing ventured - nothing gained 

Nothing ventured - nothing gained 
Nothing ventured - nothing gained 

I had a friend, his head always in the sky 
One day he said to me, c'mon and give this stuff a try 
My body hurts, my heart it aches 
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake 
That stuff hit me so bad, I'll never be the same 
But what does it matter cause I'm always game 

Nothing ventured - nothing gained 
Nothing ventured - nothing gained

Now here's a story about a lady 
You know she's one of a kind 
She works a nightclub in the city 
But she doesn't really seem to mind 

She makes me hot when she takes it off 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer 
Yeah, she'll steal your heart when she takes it off 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer 

She'll take your money because she needs to 
But she wants to be a star of the screen 
I've seen her leaving with all her lovers 
To her it's just the same old thing 

She makes me hot when she takes it off 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer 
Yeah, she'll steal your heart when she takes it off 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer 

So that's the story about the lady 
Who does it for me night till dawn 
She makes you love her like no other 
You know you're gonna miss her when she's gone 

She makes me hot when she takes it off 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer 
Yeah, she'll steal your heart when she takes it off 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer 
She's a dancer, midnight romancer

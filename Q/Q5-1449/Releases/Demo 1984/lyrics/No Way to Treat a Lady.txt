	( F. Rose / J. K. ) 

She was just sixteen, she was so sweet and clean 
She walked like she knew where she's been 
She set my blood on fire, I said are you for hire? 
That's when she turned on me and screamed 

That ain't no way to treat a lady 
That ain't no way to treat a lady 

She had a southern smile and a New York style 
I couldn't let her get away 
She was the girl of my dreams because I was mean 
I had to listen to her say 

That ain't no way to treat a lady 
That ain't no way to treat a lady 

I had to have her bad, but she'd left me mad 
That ain't the way it should be 
I'm gonna find that girl, take her around the world 
I'm gonna love her till she she screams 

That ain't no way to treat a lady 
That ain't no way to treat a lady 

Don't tell me what to do! 

That ain't no way to treat a lady 
That ain't no way to treat a lady 

To treat a lady, to treat a lady, to treat a lady

	( F. Rose / J. K. / M. Rain ) 

Street lights flicker around my town 
When day turns to night that's when I come around 
Streets are cold and damp from a midnight rain 
Buildings saggin' from the years of pain 

Cause I need the feeling 
Of living in the night 
Well you can have your security 
I'll keep on living in the night 

Everybody's workin' in the light of the day 
I know what I like 
Is living in the night 

Down on the corner sits a black and white 
Got the man in the back and they're readin' his rights 
I slip down the alley just to stay out of sight 
Looks like the law is gonna miss me tonight 

Cause I need the feeling 
Of living in the night 
When the streets are cold 
My blood runs hot in the night 

Everybody's workin' in the light of the day 
I know what I like 
Is living in the night 

Another night I spent alone 
Embraced by darkness and its hidden sounds 
I turn my blinds against the light 
And wait again the coming of the night 

Well you can have your security 
I'll keep on living in the night 
Well I need the feeling 
Of living in the night

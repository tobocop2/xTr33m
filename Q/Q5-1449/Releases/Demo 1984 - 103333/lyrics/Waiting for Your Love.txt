	( F. Rose / J. K ) 

You may be proud, so sentimental 
You think too hard but the answer's simple 
Got what I'm askin', I got the feelin' 
I got to know now, bady you must decide 

Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love 
Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love 

When the time comes, I hope you're ready 
Make your mind up, try not to cry 
I'll take it easy, I'll make you feel it 
When you know there can be no compromise 

Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love 
Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love 

I've made my mind up 
I'm gonna have you 
Cause I don't care what your best friend will say 
You're what I need to set my life free 
You know what it takes to make me stay 

Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love 
Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love

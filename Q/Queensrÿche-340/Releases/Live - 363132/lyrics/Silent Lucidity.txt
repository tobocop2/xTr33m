	Hush now, don't you cry.
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye.
You're lying safe in bed.
It was all a bad dream spinning in your head.
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain of someone close to
you leaving the game of life.
So here it is, another chance.
Wide awake you face the day.
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?
There's a place I like to hide.
A doorway that I run through in the night.
Relax child, you were there but only didn't realize it and
you were scared.
It's a place where you will learn to face your fears,
retrace the years and ride the whims of your mind.
Commanding in another world.
Suddenly, you hear and see this magic new dimension.
I - will be watching over you
I - am gonna help you see it through.
I - will protect you in the night.
I - am smiling next to you...
... In Silent Lucidity
If you open your mind for me you won't rely on open eyes to
see.
The walls you built within come tumbling down,
and a new world will begin.
Living twice at once you learn you're safe from pain in the
dream domain.
A soul set free to fly, a round trip journey in your head.
Master of illusion,
can you realize your dream's alive,
you can be the guide but...

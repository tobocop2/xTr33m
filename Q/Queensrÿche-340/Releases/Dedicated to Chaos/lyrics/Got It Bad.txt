	I like the way you walk into a room.
You take it over like it was put there just for you.
You've got those sunglasses on.

I bet you read Machiavelli in bed and I realize that I'm in way over my head ...
But I got it bad .so bad for you.
Got it bad for you! I got it bad!
Oh I'd stay up all night to see if you're the kind of girl that bites.
You're not some China Doll I'd get over soon.
You got mesmerizing advertising, want to make love to you.

Now I feel you, coming on strong.
And I could feed you if we could ever be alone.
Oh, baby, I've got it .so bad for you!
Got it bad for you! I got it bad for you!
I got it bad, bad, bad, bad dog, don't make me beg.
What you got going on with that .is more than I can take.
You've got those sunglasses on.
Now I feel you, coming on strong.
And I could feed you if I could ever get you home.
Oh, Honey, I've got it .so bad for you.
Got it bad for you!
I got it bad for you! I got it bad for you!

You caught my eye tonight and I've seen you watching me.What are you waiting for?Someday never comeWhat you say? What you got?Won't you say something?Don't just walk on by.I'm a fool to let you .go!So now you want me, my arms around you?I can't think.You've got remote control.I feel it in my soul.Baby got something for me?When will you see, just what you're doing to me?I wish I knew what to say, I think about you every day and every night in my dreams you haunt me.I'm a fool to let you go!I've seen you watching me.What are you waiting for?Someday never comes.When will you see?I can take you higher.I'm a fool to let you go.

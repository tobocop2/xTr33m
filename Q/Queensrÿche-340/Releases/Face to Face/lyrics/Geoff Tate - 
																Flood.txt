	Ask me what I believe in
I'd say compromise.
Once you know you can't deny.
If we open the flood gates...
we let it all in.
Don't lose your head...

Swim to the middle or
to the other side.
It makes no difference
I'd follow you close as a shadow.
I'd kiss your words...
but here in the sand
we've drawn the line.

Can you feel this
flood of life?
Can you feel this?
Let it all in. Yeah.

This heart of mine,
open up this flood of life.
This flood of life.
Here comes the flood.

There's some hope of love
left in those rainbow eyes.
On your way up
to touch higher ground,
you said you'd never change
this revolution heart.

Say what you will
you fly with me and
I couldn't love another.
Now ask me what I believe...
I'm lost in your chaos...
Here comes the flood
Let it all in.

Can you feel it?
Flood of life.
Feel it coming? Overflowing? Yeah.

It's this love of life.
Open up this flood of life.
If you'll open up you'll see
just what love could be.

Where you're standing now,
just feel the love.
Flood of life.
It's taking over, let it all in. Yeah.

This heart of mine, it feels the love.
Flood of life,
and it all feels right.
It feels so right.

Yeah, can you feel the flood now?
Open up and let it in.
Just open up and let it in.
This heart of mine feels the love,
feels the flood of life.
Feels right. It feels so right.

Where you're standing now,
just feel the love.
Flood of life.
It's something you can't divide,
and once you know then you'll decide.
This heart of mine feels the love,
feels the flood of life.
And it all feels right.
It feels so right

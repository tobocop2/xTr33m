	When I'm looking up, you're looking down.
Always on the outside no common ground.
I don't get what you think you're trying to be.

You know, everything you say is such a bore.
I'm just trying to hold on.
The paper in front of me is screaming but you can't see how we're dying.

Give me blue girls! Give it to me now! W
Hat will it take to convince us to change?
A hard rain ... gonna come. A hard rain is going to fall.
It's going to make Big Noize. It's gonna make Big Noize. Change your mind.

That day in September when our pants were down, I'll never forget the buildings falling round us.
They always said it couldn't happen here.
Now we're coming apart from the inside and we're mad as hell!
But all the fun is about to begin so you better jump in. Hold on!
Because we're tired of your game, rules you make, political views the money you take, golden tans, velvet ropes.
No more snow white smiles. I wish it would rain!

A hard rain's gonna come with televised opinions, so everyone can look at what's inside.
But all it takes is a moment ... and you're free.
Are you ready for that?

A hard rain gonna come. Make Big noize.
It's gonna change the world. Make Big noize.
It's just got to change. Change your mind.

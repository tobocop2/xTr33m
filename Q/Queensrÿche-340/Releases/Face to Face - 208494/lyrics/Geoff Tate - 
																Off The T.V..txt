	Is this the way out for you?
I think we have a needle eye we can pull you through.
All this static breeds mediocrity. Yeah.
It feels like maybe we're just starting to see.

Take your eyes off the TV
Take your eyes off the TV - Yeah
Take your eyes off the TV

Giving into tendencies for noise.
I realize this shakes the system
taking away their toys
I'm desensitized from holding on so tight
to this tired clich
can't sympathize.

Just take your eyes off the TV
Just take your eyes off the TV - Yeah
Take your eyes off the TV - Yeah

So... now what's it gonna be?
There's someone in an office
who decides what we see.
All things considered
by the time that you could read about it
Yeah, someone's put a spin around it.

Though you try your best in letting go.
They smile the words, keep you in the flow.
And drooling wide-eyed on the floor as you beg,
this dog, someday, will have your leg.

Something's coming...
that Face in the crowd
The sky is falling can you taste the clouds?
Patience is for those with nothing else.

I'll look behind my eyes for You,
travel outside perception too.
To places without names that don't yet exist.
We'll write down all new words
describing what they missed.

Yeah, just take your eyes off the TV
Yeah, take your eyes off the TV
Just take your eyes off the TV
Just take your eyes off the TV

Take take take

Despite the words that keep you in the flow
Despite the words that keep you in the flow
Despite the words that keep you in the flow
Despite the words... of the TV

Despite the words...

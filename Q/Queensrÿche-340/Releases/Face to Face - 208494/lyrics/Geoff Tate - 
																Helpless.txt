	Ask yourself... do you believe.
Ask yourself... why?
I feel your need of helplessness
so much I can't help myself.
Why do you need me to... save you?

I can't let you go...
can't let you go.
Save you...
I can't let you go.
I can't let you...

I surrender.
Do you feel the same?
I watch your mouth
for a sign.
We blur the distance
between the line.
I don't care if it's wrong...
all I know... is I need you.

Ask yourself why you feel
like you need me to...
save you from yourself.
And if you cared and
if you shared
everything you feel,
you'd find me... waiting.

Oh, and I'd be waiting

I can't let you go.
I can't let you go.
I can't let you go. No.
I can't let you go.

I can't let you go.
I can't let you go.
I can't let you go. No.
No!

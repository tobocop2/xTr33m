	This is not your breakdown,
woman raise your head.
This is not your madness
everybody feels this.
Woman raise your head.

With every feeling in your soul
and every loss of your control,
you can't sleep at night
'cause sleeping sometimes drives the pain away.

And no matter where we stand,
our beginning has no end.
'Cause everyday we live
we make it just a little better.

This is not our game.
We play it just the same.
With every move we make
we make it better.
Everything's the same
nothing slips away.
With every move we make
we make it better.

Everything that you can give
is the very thing that I would take from you.
I'd take from you.
With every reason why you live
is every reason I would die for you.
I'd die for you.

This is not a game.
We play it just the same.
With every move we make
we make it better.

Everything's the same
nothing slips away.
With every move we make
we make it just a little better.

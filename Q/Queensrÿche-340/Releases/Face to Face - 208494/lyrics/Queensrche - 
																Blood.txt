	Thank-you for the lies, the lies you sold us.
Thank-you for this vision of violence.
Thank-you for this song you gave me to sing.
Thank-you for the capping day
of a culture that lay dying.
Yes it's us dying.
Maybe it won't be long,
now that it's all gone on.

It's all gone wrong and
there's blood on our hands.

We saw them lying there
with their arms around each other,
staring through their fear and
the miles between our heads.
You could have told the truth.
It was your decision to
sacrifice integrity and compassion for greed.

Now it's all gone wrong and
there's blood on our hands.

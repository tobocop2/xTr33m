	Miles of desert fly, the quiet of dawn.
I ride the winds of morning to see the man thats burning.

Miles of desert fly, the quiet of dawn.

I ride the winds of morning to see the man thats burning.

In my head I hear the song a million voices strong.

I feel the heart of conscious returning, thats why the man is burning.

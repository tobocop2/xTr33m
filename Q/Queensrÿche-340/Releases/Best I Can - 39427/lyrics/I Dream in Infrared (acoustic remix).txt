	As you awoke this morning 
and opened up your eyes 
Did you notice the tear-stains 
lining your face were mine 

Don't you wonder, can't you see 
what's happening to our lives 
I can't keep living this masquerade 
When my lonely eyes see only your face at night 

I only see in infrared 
I can't dream anymore 
Can't you see I need, too 
I can't stand the pain 

You've gathered all my secrets 
and I don't know who I am 
I even feel alone when you're near 
'cause you'll never understand 

When we first met I must have seemed 
a million miles away 
It's strange how our lives have touched 
But the time is right 
I'll leave tonight 
Don't look in my eyes 
'Cause you've never seen them so black 

I only see in infrared 
I can't dream anymore 
Can't you see I need to 
I can't stand the pain

	I have so much more to say, my brother.
Can you hear me?
A fool is left to live as the brave ones fall.
I swear if I were able,
I would have done the same for you.
But now you're gone and I wish I were too.
I spend all my time asking questions,
How can I pay you back when
the price you paid was so high, my friends.
If I were King of all I imagine,
I would trade all I am
to have you by my side.
If I were King.
I have too much time today, my brother.
Can you hear me?
I know where I am, but I still feel lost.
Please know that I am grateful
for the years you gave to me.
Everything's changed,
but nothing changes for you.
I won't waste my life asking questions.
I've seen the horror of war and
there's so much more for a man who's been
where I've been.
If I were King of all I imagine,
I would trade what I have
to have you back at my side.
If I were King of all I imagine,
we would both be back home
living the rest of our lives.
If I were King.

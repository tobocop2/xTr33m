	What ever happened to conviction and faith?
People trip from side to side; don't know
which way or what side to take.
Always known the truth.
It's really black and white.
I've got no fear of judgment when it's time to fight.
We shout so loud so
that everyone can hear it.
Coming on hard like a head-on collision.
Machine like something
won't stop won't care.
Keep it all down with a
Hundred Mile Stare.
Lieutenant says, "Keep that line of drift
no matter what the course!"
"Drive 'em down the middle all the way!"
The heat and the smoke are nothing.
The flames from the fires
reflect the pride behind our mirrored eyes.
It's no surprise.  We don't compromise.
Stealing through the night, they'll never know.
They'll never see us.
Beating on the ground
as the people shout "Free us!"
Machine like something
can't stop, don't dare.
Keep it all together with a
Hundred Mile Stare.
We're coming for you!
Won't back down!
Can't stop us!
We unleash
this hell but don't worry.
Won't back down, so get ready.
I still believe and I can see it...wave!
Proud she flies.
Call the dogs!  Call out the Dogs!
We should so loud so
that everyone can hear it.
Coming on hard like a head-on collision.
Machine like something
won't stop don't care.
Keep it all down.
Hundred Mile Stare.
Stealing through the night, they'll never know,
they'll never see us.
Beating on the ground as the people shout, "Free us!"
Machine like something
Can't stop, don't dare.
Keep it all together with a
Hundred Mile Stare.

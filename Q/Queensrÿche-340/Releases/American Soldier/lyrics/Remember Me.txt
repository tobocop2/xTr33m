	For just one minute, step into my life.
Read the page and
run away with me.
The day I made that vow.
I didn't know then what I know today.
There's so much to say.
I don't know what the future holds
and I'm sorry if I seemed too cold.
A man conflicted in his head
makes poor choices, regrets the words he said.
Remember me and all the times we had.
The way I held you.
Remember me whenever you feel sad.
All I want from you
is for you to tell me that you miss me.
Will you wait for me?
Remember me...please.
Just wait one minute.  Give me a chance
and I'll make you see just what you really
mean to me.
It took a living hell to
show me.  All I want is to be with you.
You know that what I say is true.
I promise when I get back home
I'll be the man you used to know.
And I won't spend another day
without you, girl.
I need your strength.
Please stay and
remember me and all the times we had.
The way I loved you.
Remember me whenever you feel sad.
All I want from you
is for you to tell me that you miss me.
Will you wait for me?
Remember me.

My point of view is expanding everydayand I feel with clarity my vision sway.Your private access takes me all the way.(yeah!)I am amplified by what's inside of you.I feel your energy is something I can't loose.I'm a pressure cooker, I'm about to blow.I love the way that you move me,It's never enough, I've got to have you,anytime/anywhere that's all.My sweet addiction I pray will never end.Well-trained and suffering my heat for youdepends on love, like the flood,when I go down.I love the way that you move me,It's never enough, I've got to have you,anytime/anywhere that's all.Anytime/anywhereI've got to have you,I've got to have you.

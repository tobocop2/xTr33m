	I opened my eyes,
barely alive, without you.
Feeling no pain, I'm not the same without you.

Save me! Save me!

Watching you watching
me from afar, I'm... drowning. Feeling as though
we've been here before. Know what I mean?

There's a river in your eyes and I'm swept away
Breaking inside out, promising to stay
Together again, a lifetime stranded apart

Save me! Save me!

Watching you watching
me from afar, I'm... reeling. Feeling as though
we've been here before. Know what I mean?

But your river calls to me and I'm swept away.
Breaking inside out, promising to stay
Together again, a lifetime stranded apart

Save me! Save me!

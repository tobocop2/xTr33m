	Look around, on your hi-wire down look down, it's a long way to fall
Suicide, the brink of extinct it's over now
The tables have turned on life's little game
No longer the pawns you're feeling the strain
For we are all kings with merit it brings, as we rise to the top once again

As you look to the heavens wondering where you went wrong
Seeing, not always believing the gavel of life coming down

Traces of the past flash before your eyes
Hurdle the bodies that fed you, the narcissist hungers again
Fear and control your battleground, your truth under a shroud
A forced stranglehold, just do what you're told, as we rise to the top once again

As you look to the heavens wondering where you went wrong
Seeing, not always believing the gavel of life coming down

Sometimes a man's word is all that he's got and sometimes just only a name
No more suffocation, my true vindication, ascending from all the remains
This is vindication

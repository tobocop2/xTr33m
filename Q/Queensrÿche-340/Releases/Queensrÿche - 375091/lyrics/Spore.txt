	Executing realms paralyzing scenes
Mental satisfactions with violent abstractions
Playing in the dark cutting from a glass
No drop of blood emotions are not turning back
A prisoner of war is screaming from the wall
Nothing is alive only cold and dry

I am dwelling in the path seeking for the truth
What only I reach is just a broken soul

Take a look around, in the lost and found, help our fellow man
Screams of agony, final destiny waiting for the fall

Dreams are feeling sick dark pattern in the skin
Blind as you can be, you must retreat from the win

Crawling in your mind, damaging your sight, take me out of darkness to the light

Take a look around, in the lost and found, help our fellow man
Screams of agony, lost eternity waiting for the fall
Final destiny, in an endless sea ride the waves of faith and hope
(alternate) "fading...I'm always fading, what's left of me."

Take a look around, in the lost and found, help our fellow man
Screams of agony, lost eternity waiting for the fall
Final destiny, in an endless sea ride the waves of faith and hope

	So here we are again, as we plead upon our knees, this agonizing pain
Spreading like a new disease, where heroes lay to rest
When we watch our idols fall, a revolution call

Now I'm standing in the crossfire
Now I'm raising up my fist
And you'll pay for this

I'll take you there, where castles built will fall
Where dreams go to die and I promise you this

You thought you'd get away, but Karma made its move
The bad things that you've done, will be coming back for you
It's really sad that we're at the end, but my heart won't let me feel
No sympathy or pain for the outcome you've ensued

Now I'm standing in the crossfire
Now I'm raising up my fist
And you'll pay for this

I'll take you there, where castles built will fall
Where dreams go to die and I promise you this
As God as my witness, that your time will finally meet its end
Your dreams will burn and die and you cannot resist

Adapting model state, symmetry property possessed in varying degrees
(Type face that creates, mirror similarities)
A way to rise above the meaning, not to exist just for yourself

I'll take you there, where castles built will fall
Where dreams go to die and I promise you this
As God as my witness, that your time will finally meet its end
Your dreams will burn and die

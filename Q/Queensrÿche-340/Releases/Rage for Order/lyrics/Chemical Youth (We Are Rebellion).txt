	LEAD ME- the leftist cry as the right subsides

HEAR ME- the media mouth is open wide

SAVE ME- success is our hunger we need to feed

FREE ME- we will not lose to their anarchy!

We are your leaders-
we are rebellion!
aural supremists

we are rebellion!
we are future!

SHOW ME- the wave of eighties is #3

PRAISE ME- our religion is technology

CHANGE ME- alterations for the stigmatized

HELP ME - for the cause. Would you cross that line?

we are rebellion!
chemical youth scream

we are rebellion

If we don't stand together
we stand to lose the future
peace won't last forever
who will be the martyr you or me?

We can be the future
You and I the leaders, Help me!

If we don't stand together
We stand to lose the future
We are the last hope...but there's danger

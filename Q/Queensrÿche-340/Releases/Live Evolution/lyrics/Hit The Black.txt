	Hanging by a thread, problems in my head, 
don't know what I said, living to be dead on the run. 
Corporation greed, television need, 
overdose and bleed, pornograph obscene, I'm a liar. 

There's no brakes on me, as I'm running down the track. 
They'll be waiting for me, but I'm never coming back. 

I'm going down... 
to a place where I can see all there is to see in me. 

Bullets in the gun, gonna have some fun, 
think I'll take a ride to the other side, till I'm done. 
Hole is in the vein, 
feel it numb the brain, take away the pain, 
never be the same till I die. 

There's no brakes on me, as I come around the track. 
There's no gauge to read, 
peg the needle as I hit the black. 

I'm going down... 
to a place where I can see all there is to see in me. 

Population freeze, 
modern day disease, 
brings us to our knees, see them stand in line for a cure. 
Profit in the wind, 
pushing back the time that we wait in line, 
pushing back the time, it's a sin. 

There's no brakes on me, as I'm running down the track. 
They'll be waiting for me, but I'm never coming back. 

I'm going down....

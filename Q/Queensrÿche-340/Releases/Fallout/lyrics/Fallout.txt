	A sudden notion seizing the beginning
Cuts me like a knife, you used to be my valentine
The ocean in the sky, drifting
Swim against the tide, the flowing current in your eyes

And blind through the night while isolated, and on your island
(fall out, fall out, don't hesitate...fall out, fall out, don't hesitate)

Rising, rising from the ashes
A better life tomorrow finds, from a world beneath your blackest eyes

And fight through the night while isolated, and on your island
(fall out, fall out, don't hesitate...fall out, fall out, don't hesitate)

A revolution in disguise, mesmerized by the shadows
Flowing like a mental stream, a seamless laser...beam

A revolution in disguise, mesmerized by the shadows
Flowing like a mental stream, a seamless laser...beam

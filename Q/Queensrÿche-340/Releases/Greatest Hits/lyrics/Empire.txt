Last night the word came down, ten dead in Chinatown.Innocent, their only crime was being in the wrong place atthe wrong time.Too bad, people say, what's wrong with the kids today?Tell you right now they've got nothing to lose.They're building EMPIRE!Johnny used to work after school at the cinema show.Gotta hustle if he wants an education,he's got a long way to go.Now he's out on the street all day sellingCrack to the people who pay.Got an AK-47 for his best friend.Business the American way.Eastside meets Westside downtown.No time the walls fall down.Can't you feel it coming?EMPIRE!Can't you hear it calling?Black man trapped again,holds his chains in his hand.Brother killing brother for the profit of another,game point, nobody wins. Decline, right on time.What happened to the dream sublime?Tear it all down we'll put it up again.Another EMPIRE?Eastside meets Westside downtown.No time, no line, the walls fall down.Can't you feel it coming? EMPIRE!Can't you hear it coming? EMPIRE!Can't someone here stop it...?

	I know where I'm going,
and I've got all my cards showing.
I'm like the crow flies, a straight line
reaching for the other side

I dig the sand they kick at me with a calm that stuns.
Tracing time with no alibis makes me, makes me realize.

It's ok it's just a dream I had.
That there's something out there,
something, just out of reach

Armed with time on my side
and a field of vision miles wide.
I'll keep searching for some meaning
whatever makes me feel alive.

It's ok it's just a dream I had.
That there's something out there,
something, just out of reach

Today I felt something so strong it took my breath away.
Now I long
to live like this everyday.
I'll find it some way.

I'm alive with so much of life to try.
I've got no memories of what used to worry me.

It's ok it's just a dream I had.
That there's something out there,
something, just out of reach
Someday I'll reach.
It's ok it's just a dream I had.
That there's something out there,
Something just out of reach
just out of reach, just out of reach

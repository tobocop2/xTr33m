	She always brings me what I need 
Without I beg and sweat and bleed 
When we're alone at night 
Waiting for the call 
She feeds my skin 

Sixteen and on the run from home 
Found a job in Times Square 
Working Live S&M; shows 
Twenty-five bucks [a fuck] 
And John's a happy man 
She wipes the filth away 
And it's back on the streets again 

Spreading the disease 
Everybody needs 
But no one wants to see 

Father William saved her from the streets 
She drank the lifeblood from the saviour's feet 
She's Sister Mary now, eyes as cold as ice 
He takes her once a week 
On the altar like a sacrifice 

Spreading the disease 
Everybody needs 
But no one wants to see 

Religion and sex are powerplays 
Manipulate the people for the money they pay 
Selling skin, selling God 
The numbers look the same on their credit cards 
Politicians say no to drugs 
While we pay for wars in South America 

Fighting fire with empty words 
While the banks get fat 
And the poor stay poor 
And the rich get rich 
And the cops get paid 
To look away 
As the one percent rules America 

Spreading the disease 
Everybody needs 
But no one wants to see 
The way society 
Keeps spreading the disease

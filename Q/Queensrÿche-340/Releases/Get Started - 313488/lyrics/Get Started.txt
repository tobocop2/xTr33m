	We're running pretty fast, and we don't suffer fools.
We can't get what we're looking for unless we break some rules.
Time to change the view, exit same old scene.
I'm going to take my money, play it all on red.
I'm just getting started!

I'm just getting started. Just getting warmed up.
Life's too short for slowing down. You ain't seen nothing yet!

It's twenty years on and you still look good to me.
The lines on our faces remind me of places we've been and the good times we've seen.
I'm so in love with you. We're just picking up speed.
Here's my promise, I'll be a better man! I'm just getting started.

I'm just getting started here, I'm just getting going.
Life's too short for slowing down. You ain't seen nothing.
I'm just getting started here. I'm just getting warmed up.
Yeah, got my motor revved and she's rolling, rolling, you ain't seen nothing.

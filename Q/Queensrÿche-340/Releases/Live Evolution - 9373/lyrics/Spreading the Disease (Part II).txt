Religion and sex are powerplays 
Manipulate the people for the money they pay 
Selling skin, selling God 
The numbers look the same on their credit cards 
Politicians say no to drugs 
While we pay for wars in South America 

Fighting fire with empty words 
While the banks get fat 
And the poor stay poor 
And the rich get rich 
And the cops get paid 
To look away 
As the one percent rules America 

Spreading the disease 
Everybody needs 
But no one wants to see 
The way society 
Keeps spreading the disease

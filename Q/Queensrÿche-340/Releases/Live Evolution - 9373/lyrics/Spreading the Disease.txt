	She always brings me what I need 
Without I beg and sweat and bleed 
When we're alone at night 
Waiting for the call 
She feeds my skin 

Sixteen and on the run from home 
Found a job in Times Square 
Working Live S&M; shows 
Twenty-five bucks (a fuck) 
And John's a happy man 
She wipes the filth away 
And it's back on the streets again 

Spreading the disease 
Everybody needs 
But no one wants to see 

Father William saved her from the streets 
She drank the lifeblood from the saviour's feet 
She's Sister Mary now, eyes as cold as ice 
He takes her once a week 
On the alter like a sacrifice 

Spreading the disease 
Everybody needs 
But no one wants to see

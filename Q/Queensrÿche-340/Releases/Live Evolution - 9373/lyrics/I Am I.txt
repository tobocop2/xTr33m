	Beating with life you promised life, 
security, happiness. 
Unfortunate son cornered, 
cowering in the pit of 
circling panes of glass that 
surround and reveal the ever present "It". 

"It" is my move, my every look, 
interpreting gestures, 
informing other 
what's undercover and 
lurking beneath my mask 
of this year's featured model. 
Is this too much? 
Close your eyes. 
Care to look inside? I am I! 

What may appear 
might easily be explained, 
but given the situation 
of info saturation, 
what you feel can never go away. 

Steering perception? I am! 
Inviting contradiction? I am! 
It's my insistence 
you keep your distance 
from the glare behind my stare. 
So this is the way 
the game is played. 
You can leave now... 
but I think you'll stay. I am I!

	Empty room today
And here I sit
Chalk outline upon the wall
I remember tracing it
A thousand times, the night she died. 
Why? [Why?]
There's no sleep today, I can't pretend
When all my dreams are crimes
I can't stand facing them
Now who will come
To wash away my sins
Clean my room, fix my meals
Be my friend?

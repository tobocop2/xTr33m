	Lost my faith in humanity 
and I dont trust in society 
Im numb, cold, ready. 

No one else dies today . . . 

What did you do? 
I dont remember . . . 
Murderer! 
They say Im a murderer! 

God must be dead because Im still free. 
No religion holds me . . . am I the killer? 

No one else dies today . . . 

What did you do? 
Im the revenger, 
Murderer! 
No! Im the revenger! 
Murderer! 
No Im the . . . black hand of death! 

Sixty-five hundred days . . . 
Im feeling good for the first time in years. 
Your miserable life is in my hands. 
What would you do? 

Kill him! 

Does this signal an ending or another dream just beginning? Are his actions worth forgiving? 
No more pain! Revenge! 

Havent you enough? 

The dog is on his knees! 

Does this signal an ending or another dream just beginning? 
Is revenge worth any price? 
Tell me whats right? 

He wants more life! 

NO! 

You want more life? 

NO! 

Is this my victory? 

Murderer! 

Am I? 

Stay down on your knees 
and explain it to me one more time. 
What gives you the right? 
You took away my life . . . ! 
and left me with nothing, nothing. 

This is like what I dreamed . . . 
it seems like a good day to die. 

And so it ends. And now what?
